## Notes

- These files are Bird 1.x compatible:
  - [bird_roa_dn42.conf](bird_roa_dn42.conf)
  - [bird4_roa_dn42.conf](bird4_roa_dn42.conf)
  - [bird6_roa_dn42.conf](bird6_roa_dn42.conf)
- These files are Bird 2.x compatible:
  - [bird_route_dn42.conf](bird_route_dn42.conf)
  - [bird4_route_dn42.conf](bird4_route_dn42.conf)
  - [bird6_route_dn42.conf](bird6_route_dn42.conf)
- These files are [Routinator][2] and [gortr][3] ([src][6]) compatible:
  - [export_rfc8416_dn42.json](export_rfc8416_dn42.json) _(SLURM standard, format specified in [RFC 8416][4])_
- These files are [gortr][3] compatible:
  - [export_dn42.json](export_dn42.json)

Note the gortr source file is DateTime stamped only, it is not signed with any certificaty. So you will need to add
`-verify=false` as a runtime parameter when loading the cache file. Alternatively, use gortr with a slurm file
instead (e.g. `-slurm export_rfc8416_dn42.json`) as a command-line parameter.
